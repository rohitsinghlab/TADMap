# TADMap
With the recent advent of large-scale single-cell transcription chromatin conformation (HI-C) data, researchers can assess how 3D structure regulates transcription systematically across many cell types. We leverage recently developed single-cell foundation models that provide broad gene-gene coexpression estimates across a variety of cell types and cross-reference them against foundation models of chromatin architecture that estimate genomic subunits at the level of megabases (TADs).
