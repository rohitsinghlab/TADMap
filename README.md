# TAD Map
## Overview

With the advent of large-scale single-cell transcriptomic and cell type-specific chromatin conformation (HI-C) data, researchers can assess how 3D structure impacts transcription systematically across several cell types. Topologically associating domains (TADs) are contiguous segments of the genome where the genomic elements are in frequent contact with each other. The TAD Map provides a consensus estimate of this layout in human and mouse, aggregated from multiple experimental datasets. We also leverage recently developed single-cell foundation models that provide broad gene-gene coexpression estimates across a variety of cell types and cross-reference them against gene groupings designated by TAD Map. 

## Resources
